# FizzBuzz Neural Network

Welcome to the FizzBuzz Neural Network repository! This repository provides code and tutorials to help you solve the classic FizzBuzz problem using neural networks. Next time you see this problem in an interview, you'll be prepared with a cutting-edge solution that shows your interviewer that you're ready to bring AI solutions to any and every problem space.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a simple programming problem that is often used as an interview question. The goal is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

## Why Neural Networks?


## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains any necessary data files. In this case, we do not require any external data.

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the process of solving the FizzBuzz problem using neural networks.

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the FizzBuzz neural network model.

- `tutorials/`: This directory contains additional tutorials and resources to help you understand neural networks and their application to the FizzBuzz problem.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/fizzbuzz-neural-network.git`


2. Install the required dependencies:
   
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Explore the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter notebooks that guide you through solving the FizzBuzz problem. Start with the introductory notebook to understand the problem and basic concepts of neural networks.

4. Once you are familiar with the concepts, you can explore the `src/` directory to see the implementation of the FizzBuzz neural network model. Modify the code and experiment with different network architectures or training strategies.

5. For additional tutorials on neural networks and their applications, check out the `tutorials/` directory.
